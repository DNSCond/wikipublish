# wikipublish

wikipublish creates a post with a text area that moderators can use to edit the wiki.
under it are travel buttons and a publish section.

while non mods cannot edit the wiki, they can write on the textbox without changing anything.

## what are "Time URL"s and what is "`clock.ant.ractoc.com`"?
