# Time URLs

Time URLs are my way to conviently use reddit syntax to its advantage by replacing urls to
`clock.ant.ractoc.com` with a [HTMLTimeElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/time),
that domain is however, never called in the devvit app, its sole purpose is to be recognized.
